### Get_Next_Line - A Step Towards Advanced File Handling  

Get_Next_Line is a project I worked on to deepen my understanding of file handling and dynamic memory management in C. This function is designed to read a line from a file descriptor, one at a time, regardless of the line's length. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, as it required combining low-level programming skills with attention to detail and efficiency.  

#### What I’ve Achieved:  
1. **Dynamic Line Reading**:  
   I implemented a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns one line at a time, adapting to varying buffer sizes and handling multi-line files seamlessly.  

2. **Memory Management**:  
   Managing buffers, dynamic memory allocation, and freeing unused memory were critical components of this project. I worked hard to ensure no memory leaks occur during execution.  

3. **Error Handling**:  
   I added checks to handle invalid file descriptors, failed memory allocations, and other potential issues gracefully.  

4. **Modularity**:  
   The function is divided into smaller helper functions to keep the code clean and maintainable, adhering to a modular design.  

#### Highlights of the Development Process:  
- **BUFFER_SIZE Testing**:  
  I tested the function with various `BUFFER_SIZE` values, from small numbers like 1 to large ones like 10000000, to ensure flexibility and reliability.  

- **Edge-Case Handling**:  
  Special attention was given to edge cases, such as files ending without a newline, empty files, or extremely long lines.  

- **Custom Testing**:  
  I wrote test cases with both valid and invalid file descriptors, ensuring the function handles all scenarios as expected.  

This project was a major milestone in my programming journey. It taught me how to approach complex problems step by step, manage memory effectively, and write code that can adapt to different scenarios. Get_Next_Line is more than just a function—it’s a demonstration of my growth as a programmer and my ability to tackle challenging tasks.
